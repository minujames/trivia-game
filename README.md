# National Park Trivia
This is a trivia game about the national parks in the US. Each question has a set timeout and if the user fails to give an answer during that interval, it will move on to the next question. After each question the game will evaluate the answer and shows the result. At the end of the trivia, the number of right answers is displayed and a Restart button to replay the game.
